Sports Team Cards Project
This project is focused on learning and applying modern JavaScript methods by building dynamic football team cards. The application processes datasets and outputs key team information to the screen, allowing users to interact with the content in various ways.

Key Learning Areas:
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically update and modify the web page based on user interactions.
Object Destructuring: Efficiently extract and manage data from objects.
Event Handling: Handle user inputs and interactions, such as clicks and filters.
Data Filtering: Filter and display specific team data based on user queries or conditions.
This project is part of my journey to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and front-end development.
